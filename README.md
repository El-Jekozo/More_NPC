My More_NPC mod that adds new NPCs with quest lines. Currently WIP. Not recomended for use. Download at your own risk (or if you want to help with testing). Expect bugs, errors, exploits, gibberish instead of dialogues etc.

Progress so far:
  Regular NPC:
	Berry Button - 3 quests; unchecked dialogues for mistakes, spelling errors, (actual text) etc; most wanted features implemented; few features don't work as wanted, have bugs, exploits etc.
	
  Teachers:
	Wanderer Knight - 2 quests; 1 minor quest; unchecked dialogues for mistakes, spelling errors etc;
	Black Belt Master - 4 quests; 1 minot quest; unchecked dialogues for mistakes, spelling errors etc;
	Police CQC Teacher - 4 quests; unchecked dialogues for mistakes, spelling errors etc; few wanted features implemented (all untested); 
	Old Assassin - WIP
	
  Minor (potential teachers)
	Flame Knuckle leader - 1 quest; 1 minor quest; most wanted features implemented; most features untested; few features don't work as wanted, have bugs, exploits etc
